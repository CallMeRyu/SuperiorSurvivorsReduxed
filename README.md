# Update 17 Experimental

The start of EXP 17 has started. It's at a point where we're unsure if it's safe to update to the workshop but enough to give a try on github
Please provide bug reports / feedback on the steamgroup or discord!


## The start of EXP 17
- Started to work on the Guard Job: Guards should be smart enough to not 'let their guard down' for when enemies are near
- A new 'TempGuard' area started. In future EXP updates, you will be able to create a secondary guard area. 
- FIX: 'Select area' will not reset when you're trying to click on 'SET' (Need more feedback)
